# knotinfo_data_complete.xls

This is a copy of the knotinfo database as an Excel file.  It includes some invariants that no longer appear on the website and perhaps some that have not been made available through the website, perhaps because they haven't been carefully checked.

For each invariant, there are two columns.  The first contains the invariant value.  The second is for internal use; it points to a comment, for instance giving information about who contributed the value.  The first rows contain names (for external and internal use).  For the most part, the structure should be self-explanatory.
